* User functions

** Cruise Control
   - vehicle automatically maintains a set speed
   - driver is in charge of maintaining safety distance

** Adaptive Cruise Control
   - vehicle maintains distance to the preceding vehicle including braking until a full standstill and starting from standstill

** Distance Warning
   - vehicle warns driver VISUALLY (AND/OR) ACOUSTICALLY if vehicle is closer to the car ahead than allowed by the safety distance

** Emergency Brake Assist
   - vehicle decelerates in critical situations to a full standstill

** Speed Limit
   - vehicle does not exceed a set speed

** Sign Recognition
   - vehicle sets the speed limit automatically according to the recognized signs

** Traffic Jam Following
   - vehicle accelerates from a standstill when the preceding vehicle departs


* User Interface

** Cruise Control Lever
   - cruise control
   - speed limiter
   - rotary switch (to control safety distance)
*** DEFAULT POSITION is in NEUTRAL when not touched by user -> signaled via SCSLever
*** CHECK POSSIBLE MOVEMENTS


* Sensors
  - keyState   {NoKeyInserted, KeyInserted, KeyInIgnitionOnPosition}
  - engineOn   {True, False}
  - brakePedal {0 -> no deflection, 225 -> max 45ยบ deflection}
  - radar system -> state: rangeRadarState ; obstacle detection: rangeRadarSensor

* Actuators
  - current speed of vehicle controlled via setVehicleSpeed
  - brake controlled (desacelerate or emergency brake) via brakePressure
  - acoustic or visual warning in dangerous situation via acousticWarningOn and visualWarningOn

* Software Functions
** TODO Setting and Modifying desired speed
** TODO Cruise Control
** TODO Adaptive Cruise Control
** TODO Distance Warning
** TODO Emergency Brake Assistant
** TODO Speed Limit
** TODO Traffic Sign Detection
** TODO Fault Handling and General Properties
